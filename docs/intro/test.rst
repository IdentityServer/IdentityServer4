Demo Server and Tests
=====================

You can try IdentityServer4 with your favourite client library. We have a test instance at `demo.identityserver.io <https://demo.identityserver.io>`_. 
On the main page you can find instructions on how to configure your client and how to call an API.

Furthermore we have a repo that exercises a variety of IdentityServer and Web API combinations (IdentityServer 3 and 4, ASP.NET Core and Katana).
We use this test harness to make sure all permutations work. You can test it yourself by cloning `this <https://github.com/IdentityServer/CrossVersionIntegrationTests>`_ repo.
