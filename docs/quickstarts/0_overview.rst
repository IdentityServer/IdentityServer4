Overview
========
The quickstarts provide step by step instructions for various common IdentityServer scenarios.
They start with the absolute basics and become more complex - 
it is recommended you do them in order.

* adding IdentityServer to an ASP.NET Core application
* configuring IdentityServer
* issuing tokens for various clients
* securing web applications and APIs
* adding support for EntityFramework based configuration
* adding support for ASP.NET Identity
* adding AdminUI community edition to manage users and configuration

Every quickstart has a reference solution - you can find the code in the 
`samples <https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4/tree/master/samples/Quickstarts>`_ folder.

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^
The first thing you should do is install our templates::

    dotnet new -i IdentityServer4.Templates

They will be used as a starting point for the various tutorials.

OK - let's get started!
