IdentityServer4 is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core.

.. warning:: 
   As of Oct, 1st 2020, we started a new `company <https://duendesoftware.com/>`_. 
   All new major feature work will happen in our new `organization <https://github.com/duendesoftware>`_. 
   The new Duende IdentityServer is available under both a FOSS (RPL) and a commercial license. 
   Development and testing is always free. 
   `Contact <https://duendesoftware.com/contact>`_ us for more information. 
   
   IdentityServer4 will be maintained with bug fixes and security updates until November 2022. 


.. note:: This docs cover the latest version on main branch. This might not be released yet. Use the version picker in the lower left corner to select docs for a specific version.

It enables the following features in your applications:


| **Authentication as a Service** 
| Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services). IdentityServer is an officially `certified <https://openid.net/certification/>`_ implementation of OpenID Connect.

| **Single Sign-on / Sign-out** 
| Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

| **Access Control for APIs** 
| Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

| **Federation Gateway**
| Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc. This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

| **Focus on Customization**
| The most important part - many aspects of IdentityServer can be customized to fit **your** needs. Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.

| **Mature Open Source**
| IdentityServer uses the permissive `Apache 2 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license that allows building commercial products on top of it. It is also part of the `.NET Foundation <https://dotnetfoundation.org/>`_ which provides governance and legal backing.

| **Free and Commercial Support**
| If you need help building or running your identity platform, :ref:`let us know <refSupport>`. There are several ways we can help you out.
