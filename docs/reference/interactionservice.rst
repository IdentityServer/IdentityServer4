.. _refInteractionService:
IdentityServer Interaction Service
==================================

The ``IIdentityServerInteractionService`` interface is intended to provide services to be used by the user interface to communicate with IdentityServer, mainly pertaining to user interaction.
It is available from the dependency injection system and would normally be injected as a constructor parameter into your MVC controllers for the user interface of IdentityServer.

IIdentityServerInteractionService APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``GetAuthorizationContextAsync``
    Returns the ``AuthorizationRequest`` based on the ``returnUrl`` passed to the login or consent pages.

``IsValidReturnUrl``
    Indicates if the ``returnUrl`` is a valid URL for redirect after login or consent.

``GetErrorContextAsync``
    Returns the ``ErrorMessage`` based on the ``errorId`` passed to the error page.

``GetLogoutContextAsync``
    Returns the ``LogoutRequest`` based on the ``logoutId`` passed to the logout page.

``CreateLogoutContextAsync``
    Used to create a ``logoutId`` if there is not one presently.
    This creates a cookie capturing all the current state needed for signout and the ``logoutId`` identifies that cookie.
    This is typically used when there is no current ``logoutId`` and the logout page must capture the current user's state needed for sign-out prior to redirecting to an external identity provider for signout.
    The newly created ``logoutId`` would need to be round-tripped to the external identity provider at signout time, and then used on the signout callback page in the same way it would be on the normal logout page.

``GrantConsentAsync``
    Accepts a ``ConsentResponse`` to inform IdentityServer of the user's consent to a particular ``AuthorizationRequest``.

``DenyAuthorizationAsync``
    Accepts a ``AuthorizationError`` to inform IdentityServer of the error to return to the client for a particular ``AuthorizationRequest``.

``GetAllUserGrantsAsync``
    Returns a collection of ``Grant`` for the user. These represent a user's consent or a clients access to a user's resource.

``RevokeUserConsentAsync``
    Revokes all of a user's consents and grants for a client.

``RevokeTokensForCurrentSessionAsync``
    Revokes all of a user's consents and grants for clients the user has signed into during their current session.
