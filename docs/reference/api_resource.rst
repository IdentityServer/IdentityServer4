.. _refApiResource:
API Resource
=================
This class model an API resource.

``Enabled``
    Indicates if this resource is enabled and can be requested. Defaults to true.
``Name``
    The unique name of the API. This value is used for authentication with introspection and will be added to the audience of the outgoing access token.
``DisplayName``
    This value can be used e.g. on the consent screen.
``Description``
    This value can be used e.g. on the consent screen.
``ApiSecrets``
    The API secret is used for the introspection endpoint. The API can authenticate with introspection using the API name and secret.
``UserClaims``
    List of associated user claim types that should be included in the access token.
``Scopes``
    An API must have at least one scope. Each scope can have different settings.


Scopes
^^^^^^
In the simple case an API has exactly one scope. But there are cases where you might want to sub-divide the functionality of an API, 
and give different clients access to different parts.

``Name``
    The unique name of the scope. This is the value a client will use for the scope parameter in the authorize/token request.
``DisplayName``
    This value can be used e.g. on the consent screen.
``Description``
    This value can be used e.g. on the consent screen.
``Required``
    Specifies whether the user can de-select the scope on the consent screen (if the consent screen wants to implement such a feature). Defaults to false.
``Emphasize``
    Specifies whether the consent screen will emphasize this scope (if the consent screen wants to implement such a feature). Use this setting for sensitive or important scopes. Defaults to false.
``ShowInDiscoveryDocument``
    Specifies whether this scope is shown in the discovery document. Defaults to true.
``UserClaims``
    List of associated user claim types that should be included in the access token. The claims specified here will be added to the list of claims specified for the API.

Convenience Constructor Behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just a note about the constructors provided for the ``ApiResource`` class.

For full control over the data in the ``ApiResource``, use the default constructor with no parameters.
You would use this approach if you wanted to configure multiple scopes per API. 
For example::

    new ApiResource
    {
        Name = "api2",

        Scopes =
        {
            new Scope()
            {
                Name = "api2.full_access",
                DisplayName = "Full access to API 2"
            },
            new Scope
            {
                Name = "api2.read_only",
                DisplayName = "Read only access to API 2"
            }
        }
    }

For simpler scenarios where you only require one scope per API, then several convenience constructors which accept a ``name`` are provided.
For example::

    new ApiResource("api1", "Some API 1")

Using the convenience constructor is equivalent to this::

    new ApiResource
    {
        Name = "api1",
        DisplayName = "Some API 1",

        Scopes =
        {
            new Scope()
            {
                Name = "api1",
                DisplayName = "Some API 1"
            }
        }
    }


Defining API resources in appsettings.json
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``AddInMemoryApiResource`` extensions method also supports adding clients from the ASP.NET Core configuration file. This allows you to define static clients directly from the appsettings.json file::

    "IdentityServer": {
      "IssuerUri": "urn:sso.company.com",
      "ApiResources": [
        {
          "Name": "api1",
          "DisplayName": "My API",

          "Scopes": [
            {
              "Name": "api1",
              "DisplayName": "My API"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

Then pass the configuration section to the ``AddInMemoryApiResource`` method::

    AddInMemoryApiResources(configuration.GetSection("IdentityServer:ApiResources"))
