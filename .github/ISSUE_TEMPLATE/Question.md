Please only use the issue tracker for simple questions. For general security questions, or free / commercial support options do __not__ use the issue tracker and instead see [here](http://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/intro/support.html) for more details.

For questions containing large amounts of code we recommend submitting a question on stack overflow using the [Identity Server 4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/identityserver4). Our amazing community on Stack Overflow is there to help answer all of your questions.

Finally, please keep the issue concise and to the point if your question does include code be sure it is a [Minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). If you paste in more code than the text for your question then it probably belongs on Stack overflow.
