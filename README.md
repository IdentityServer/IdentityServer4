# Important update
As of Oct 1st 2020, we started a new [company](https://duendesoftware.com/). All new feature work will happen in our new [organization](https://github.com/duendesoftware).
The new Duende IdentityServer is available under both a FOSS (RPL) and a commercial license. Development and testing is always free. [Contact](https://duendesoftware.com/contact) us for more information. This repo will be maintained with bug fixes and security updates until November 2022.

## About IdentityServer4
[<img align="right" width="100px" src="https://dotnetfoundation.org/img/logo_big.svg" />](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects?searchquery=IdentityServer&type=project)

IdentityServer is a free, open source [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) framework for ASP.NET Core.
Founded and maintained by [Dominick Baier](https://twitter.com/leastprivilege) and [Brock Allen](https://twitter.com/brocklallen), IdentityServer4 incorporates all the protocol implementations and extensibility points needed to integrate token-based authentication, single-sign-on and API access control in your applications.
IdentityServer4 is officially [certified](https://openid.net/certification/) by the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net) and thus spec-compliant and interoperable.
It is part of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/), and operates under their [code of conduct](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). It is licensed under [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) (an OSI approved license).
